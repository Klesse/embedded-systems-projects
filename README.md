# 📟 Embedded Systems Projects

This are some projects made on my embedded systems classes at college. They 
consists in low-level programming for embedded devices, in this case the 
8952 microcontroller. The codes were made in assembly and in C.


## Projects

1. 7️⃣  Seven Segments Display

This project was an easy one just to understand the 8952 assembly syntax and 
how to interact with the I/O ports of the microcontroller.

2. 🔐 Safe Password Display

This one was a program that displays in a LCD to enter an password, simulating 
as it was for acessing a safe. This code is also made in assembly.

3. 🦖 T-Rex Game

The last project was a copy of Dino's game from Google, using a LCD and the 
8952 microcontroller. The game can be played using buttons to jump and return 
the T-Rex to the ground.
